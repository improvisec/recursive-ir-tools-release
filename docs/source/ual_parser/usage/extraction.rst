Extraction
==========


Stored audit logs can be extracted from the databse using the ual_parser. All data are de-duplicated already as previously mentioned, and with added geo-location information.

The following screenshot shows logs being extracted from one of the databases present. The extraction process is lightning-quick as database entries are memory mapped in the LMDB database.
