Applications
============

Threat actors often register applications to perform various actions such as email exfiltration, mass phishing campaigns, or even to establish or maintain their foothold in the victim's M365 tenant. 

The "applications" tab provides a list of applications registered by a user which, when they were registered, which, along with other signals, will provide some level of confidence that the account has been compromised (e.g., when the application is known to be used for malicious purposes). The clickable links (also found in other tabs) point to the specific line in the "events" tab where the actual audit data can be found.
