ISP Stats
=========

This tab provides a list of ASNs from where the user successfully logged in from along with how many days when at least one successful login is recorded. Microsoft keeps track of geo-location information along with other telemetries to flag "risky sign-ins" and "risky users" in the Entra ID - Identity Protection dashboard (assuming the tenant has a valid subscription license).

SIEM providers who offer M365 log ingestion or integration should consider building use cases around these telemetries as it is quite easy to implement.
