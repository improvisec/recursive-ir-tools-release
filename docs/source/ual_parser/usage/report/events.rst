Events
======

Finally, the events tab contains all events associated with every user or service principal, along with geo-location enrichment, GUID mappings, and the actual 'audit_data' field containing the raw event log which can be inspected further. Epoch timestamps are also added for easy sorting, although events are already sorted in this tab.
