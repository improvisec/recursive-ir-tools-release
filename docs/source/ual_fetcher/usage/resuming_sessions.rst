Resuming Sessions
=================

If online audit log acquisition suddenly gets interrupted, it can be resumed as the program keeps track of each log retrieval's progress. When you select ual_fetcher from the main menu, a list of existing sessions are displayed:

The original search duration start as well as the number of days to search are displayed. If the "Resume Start/Remaining(days)" column is populated, it means if the item is selected, it will start retrieving logs from that Resume Start date with the duration as specified (e.g., /44).
