recursive-ir-tools documentation
================================

Welcome to the Recursive IR Tools documentation. This project is going to be a collection of DFIR tools I built (and will build) to help automate various tasks involved in detection engineering, incident response, and digital forensics investigations. Commercial digital forensics tools are particularly expensive given that these tools are used in paid engagements. My goal is to build individual alternative tools for different tasks where no other freely available tool exists which serves such purpose.
