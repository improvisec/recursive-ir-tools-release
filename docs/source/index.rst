**Recursive IR Tools** automate various tasks involved in incident response investigations including artefacts collection, log parsing, analysis, and reporting. 
The goal is to determine as quick as possible the following or at least assess with a reasonable level of confidence:

1. How the attacker got in - find the entry point (so we can close this hole)
2. Which assets were touched - determine the scope of the breach (so we know which assets/accounts to remediate)
3. Persistence mechanisms - find any implant or backdoor accounts (so we can cut their access)
4. Evidence of exfiltration - determine what has been taken (to find out any further remediation steps needed)
